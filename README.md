## Web scraper built to help my wife.

My wife was having to manually collect data from a website for her job. The task would take hours and she asked if I could help. I built this web scraper with Python, Selenium, Tkinter, and Pandas. Tkinter handled the user interface that was easy for her to enter the credentials to log in. Selenium navigated through the website and located the data that needed to be retrieved. Pandas was used to clean the data and return it in a HTML document.
